    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I was experimenting in the kitchen with milk and sugar, when suddenly the idea of chocolate came to my mind. I looked in the cabinet and saw a fresh bottle of chocolate syrup. I added it to my hot cup of milk and sugar and ta-da! Secret simple hot chocolate! Add marshmallows, whipped cream, or Cool Whip® to make even tastier.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chocolate syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir milk and sugar together in a microwave-safe glass or mug. Microwave until hot, about 2 minutes. Stir in chocolate syrup until completely incorporated.</li> 
    </ol>
